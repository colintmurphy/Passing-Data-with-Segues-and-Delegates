# Passing-Data-with-Segues-and-Delegates

## About
- Through segues, data is passed from vc1 to vc2, vc2 to vc3

- Through delegates, data is passed directly from vc2 to vc1, and from vc3 to vc1

- When running, notice there is no delegation from vc3 to vc2 (so the data will not be passed back from 2 to 3, so the app will behave differently)
