# Passing-Data-with-Segues-and-Delegates
This app has three view controllers.

Through segues, data is passed from vc1 to vc2, vc2 to vc3

Through delegates, data is passed directly from vc2 to vc1, and from vc3 to vc1
- notice there is no delegation from vc3 to vc2 (so the data will not be passed back from 2 to 3, so the app will behave differently)
